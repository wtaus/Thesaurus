In this context, there are two main causes for sea-level rise: (1) the expansion of seawater as the oceans warm; and (2) the run-off into the ocean of water from melting ice sheet and glaciers. Current sea levels are about 20cm higher on average than they were in 1900. Year on year, sea levels are presently going up by just over 3mm."},"sea surface temperature (sst)":{"term":"Sea Surface Temperature (SST)","definition":"The sea surface temperature is the subsurface bulk temperature in the top few meters of the ocean, measured by ships, buoys, and drifters. From ships, measurements of water samples in buckets were mostly switched in the 1940s to samples from engine intake water. Satellite measurements of skin temperature (uppermost layer; a fraction of a millimeter thick) in the infrared or the top centimeter or so in the microwave are also used, but must be adjusted to be compatible with the bulk temperature."},"sequestration":{"term":"Sequestration","definition":"The addition of a substance of concern to a reservoir."},"small island developing states (sids)":{"term":"Small island developing states (SIDS)","definition":"Small island developing states (SIDS), as recognised by the United Nations OHRLLS (Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States), are a distinct group of developing countries facing specific social, economic and environmental vulnerabilities (UN-OHRLLS, 2011). They were recognized as a special case both for their environment and development at the Rio Earth Summit in Brazil in 1992. Fifty-eight countries and territories are presently classified as SIDS by the UN OHRLLS, with 38 being UN member states and 20 being Non-UN Members or Associate Members of the Regional Commissions (UN-OHRLLS, 2018)."},"social cost of carbon":{"term":"Social Cost of Carbon","definition":"The net present value of aggregate climate damages (with overall harmful damages expressed as a number with positive sign) from one more tonne of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2), conditional on a global emissions trajectory over time."},"soil carbon sequestration (scs)":{"term":"Soil carbon sequestration (SCS)","definition":"Land management changes which increase the soil organic carbon content, resulting in a net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere."},"stratosphere":{"term":"Stratosphere","definition":"The highly stratified region of the atmosphere above the troposphere extending from about 10 km (ranging from 9 km at high latitudes to 16 km in the tropics on average) to about 50 km altitude."},"sustainability":{"term":"Sustainability","definition":"Sustainability means consuming the planet's resources at a rate at which they can be replenished. It's sometimes known as sustainable development. Types of renewable energy such as solar or wind power are described as sustainable, while using wood from managed forests where trees are replanted according to how many are cut down is another example."},"sustainable development goals":{"term":"Sustainable Development Goals","definition":"The 17 global goals for development for all countries established by the United Nations through a participatory process and elaborated in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including ending poverty and hunger; ensuring health and well-being, education, gender equality, clean water and energy, and decent work; building and ensuring resilient and sustainable infrastructure, cities and consumption; reducing inequalities; protecting land and water ecosystems; promoting peace, justice and partnerships; and taking urgent action on climate change."},"technology transfer":{"term":"Technology transfer","definition":"The exchange of knowledge, hardware and associated software, money and goods among stakeholders, which leads to the spread of technology for adaptation or mitigation. The term encompasses both diffusion of technologies and technological cooperation across and within countries."},"tipping point":{"term":"Tipping point","definition":"Describes how the climate may suddenly change after passing a tipping point, making it even harder to stop or reverse. Scientists say it is urgent that policy-makers halve global carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 or risk triggering changes that could be irreversible."},"transportation":{"term":"Transportation","definition":"https:\/\/www.mission1point5learn.org\/transport"},"tropical cyclone":{"term":"Tropical cyclone","definition":"The general term for a strong, cyclonic-scale disturbance that originates over tropical oceans. Distinguished from weaker systems (often named tropical disturbances or depressions) by exceeding a threshold wind speed. A tropical storm is a tropical cyclone with one-minute average surface winds between 18 and 32 m s-1. Beyond 32 m s-1, a tropical cyclone is called a hurricane, typhoon, or cyclone, depending on geographic location."},"unep":{"term":"UNEP","definition":""},"unfccc":{"term":"UNFCCC","definition":"Stands for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This is an international treaty, signed at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, which stated that countries should work to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to avoid dangerous climate change."},"united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc)":{"term":"United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)","definition":"The UNFCCC was adopted in May 1992 and opened for signature at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. It entered into force in March 1994 and as of May 2018 had 197 Parties (196 States and the European Union). The Convention\u2019s ultimate objective is the \u2018stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.\u2019 The provisions of the Convention are pursued and implemented by two treaties: the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement."},"vulnerability":{"term":"Vulnerability","definition":"The propensity or predisposition to be adversely AI affected. Vulnerability encompasses a variety of concepts and elements including sensitivity or susceptibility to harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt."},"well being":{"term":"Well Being","definition":"A state of existence that fulfils various human needs, including material living conditions and quality of life, as well as the ability to pursue one\u2019s goals, to thrive, and feel satisfied with one\u2019s life.
